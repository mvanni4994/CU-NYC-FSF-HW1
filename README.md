# CU-NYC-FSF-HW1

The objective of this homework was to refactor the code for a website. 
In order to do so, we were givin both a CSS and HTML code.
On VSC we were to consolidate code and refactor it to the best of our ability while still maintaining the integrity of the webpage. 
Once complete, we were to create a repository on github and push the updated code to said repository.
